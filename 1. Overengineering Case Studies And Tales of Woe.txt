# 1. OVERENGINEERING CASE STUDIES AND TALES OF WOE
--------------------------------------------------

* What they wanted isn't what they needed
-----------------------------------------
A web developer is looking for work. In the neighborhood, there's a new specialty store and they don't have a website. So they reach out. Sounds like a good fit. The owner wants to 
advertise their specials, start a blog about the business and show off the space. There's pages upon pages of requirements and they want to do. 

Sounds fantastic. And there are web frameworks that will do everything they need. Here's the hourly rate, agreed. Here's the deliverables and design and everything sounds good. Days, 
then weeks pass, the site is built with most of the controls and customizations the customer asked for. The owner is happy and cuts a check, and the web developer happily cashes it. 
The domain is advertised and everyone lives happily ever after. Except, the site is stagnant. 

The specials aren't getting updated. The blog has a couple entries and nobody's commenting on them. There's a large number of third party modules in the site and maintenance is becoming a 
hassle. Looking at the analytics, people aren't so much bouncing, as just not coming. A few months pass, the site is the same. 

A year or two passes and the business closes, and the site is quietly retired. What did the business ask for? A complicated website with lots of bells and whistles. 

What did they need? Probably just a social media page. At the end of the day, the service provider did what the customer wanted, but it wasn't what they needed.
